# User Guide: New Widget and Navigation System

## Overview
This update introduces a redesigned widget system and improved navigation to make attendance tracking more intuitive and efficient.

## New Widget Options

You now have **three widget options** to choose from when adding widgets to your home screen:

### 1. Compact Widget (2x2)
**Best for**: Quick overview without taking much space
- **Size**: 2 tiles wide × 2 tiles tall
- **Features**:
  - Read-only display (no input buttons)
  - Shows up to 2 subjects
  - Displays attendance percentage for each subject
  - Color-coded: Green (above target) or Red (below target)
  - Dark theme support (AMOLED compatible)

**When to use**: When you want a small widget that shows your most important subjects at a glance without interacting with it.

### 2. Large Widget (5x2)
**Best for**: Quick attendance marking without opening the app
- **Size**: 5 tiles wide × 2 tiles tall (full width)
- **Features**:
  - Interactive attendance marking
  - Shows up to 5 subjects
  - Quick action buttons: P (Present), A (Absent), NC (No Class)
  - Displays current attendance percentage
  - Scrollable if you have more than 5 subjects
  - Updates immediately when you mark attendance
  - Dark theme support (AMOLED compatible)

**When to use**: When you want to quickly mark attendance directly from your home screen without opening the app.

### 3. Original Widget (3x2)
**Best for**: Balanced view with moderate detail
- **Size**: 3 tiles wide × 2 tiles tall
- **Features**:
  - Read-only display
  - Shows up to 3 subjects
  - Displays attendance count (e.g., "15/20 attended")
  - Shows percentage with color coding
  - Dark theme support (AMOLED compatible)

**When to use**: When you want more detail than the compact widget but don't need interaction buttons.

## New Navigation System

### Home Screen Changes

The home screen is now **cleaner and more focused**:

1. **Date Header**: Shows today's date in a colored card at the top
2. **Subject Cards**: Each subject is displayed in a card with:
   - Subject name and visual hint "Tap to view calendar"
   - Large pie chart showing attendance percentage
   - Attendance statistics (Present/Absent/Total)
   - Helpful guidance (e.g., "You can bunk 2 classes" or "Attend next 3 classes")
   - Quick attendance buttons (P/A/NC) for today

### Per-Subject Calendar

**New feature**: Each subject now has its own dedicated calendar!

**How to access**:
1. From the home screen, **tap on any subject card**
2. You'll see a calendar view for that specific subject
3. The calendar shows only that subject's attendance history

**Features**:
- View attendance history for the selected subject
- Color-coded dates (Green = Present, Red = Absent, Gray = No Class)
- Select any date to mark/change attendance
- Quick action buttons to mark attendance for selected date
- Back button returns to home screen

**Why this is better**:
- Focused view per subject
- Easier to track individual subject attendance
- Less cluttered than showing all subjects on one calendar
- Faster to find specific dates for a subject

### Bottom Navigation

The bottom navigation bar now has **4 tabs** instead of 5:

1. **Home** 🏠
   - View all subjects
   - Quick attendance marking
   - Click subjects to view their calendar

2. **Subjects** 📚
   - Add/edit/delete subjects
   - Manage subject folders
   - Configure attendance counts

3. **Schedule** 📅
   - Set weekly schedule
   - Add classes for each day

4. **Settings** ⚙️
   - Theme customization (Light/Dark/AMOLED)
   - Color customization
   - About information

**Removed**: The general Calendar tab
**Why**: It's replaced by per-subject calendars which are more useful and focused

## Settings Screen Changes

The Settings screen is now **simpler and more focused**:

**What's there**:
- **Customizations**: Change themes and colors
- **About**: App information

**What's removed**:
- Subject attendance targets (moved to Subjects tab)
- Subject list from settings

**Why this change**:
- Settings now contains only app-level preferences
- Subject management is in the Subjects tab where it logically belongs
- Cleaner, less confusing interface
