## Building the Project

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Hedgehog or newer
- JDK 17
- Android SDK 36

### Build Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hrishikeshp7/Self-Attendance-Tracker.git
cd Self-Attendance-Tracker
```

2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Sync Gradle files

4. Build and run on an emulator or physical device:
```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Or use Android Studio's Run button.

### Release Builds and Keystore Setup

To ensure that users can upgrade between releases without "app not installed - conflicts with other package" errors, all release builds **must be signed with the same keystore**. 

#### For Repository Maintainers

If you're building releases via GitHub Actions, configure the following secrets:

1. Generate a keystore file once (only needs to be done once):
```bash
keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore release.keystore -alias release \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
  -storepass YourSecurePassword -keypass YourSecureKeyPassword \
  -dname "CN=AttendanceTracker, OU=Development, O=AttendanceTracker, L=City, ST=State, C=US"
```

2. Encode the keystore to base64:
```bash
base64 release.keystore > release.keystore.base64
```

3. Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):
   - `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_BASE64`: Contents of `release.keystore.base64`
   - `RELEASE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`: The password you used for `-storepass`
   - `RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS`: The alias you used (e.g., "release")
   - `RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD`: The password you used for `-keypass`

4. **Important**: Keep the original `release.keystore` file in a secure location as a backup. If you lose it, you won't be able to update the app for existing users.

#### For Local Release Builds

For release builds, you must use a valid keystore file and set the required environment variables. The build will fail if these are not provided.

```bash
export KEYSTORE_FILE=path/to/release.keystore
export KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=your_password
export KEY_ALIAS=release
export KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
./gradlew assembleRelease
```
